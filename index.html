              Borus is one of the most beautiful and popular tourist destinations in the Krasnoyarsk Krai. It has been
              considered sacred to the Khakass people since ancient times, and esotericists speak of the mountain
              range's energetic wealth. The range comprises four peaks: Kubinskikh Revolyutsionerov Peak, Bolshoi
              (Glavny) Borus, Maly Borus, and Koshurnikov Peak. All four peaks are connected by gentle slopes. The
              highest point of the range is Bolshoi Borus, reaching 2,318 meters above sea level.

                  individual tours were offered. However, in 2021, tours were launched—at first, only for power
                  engineering students, but then the facility's management signed an agreement with tour operators.
